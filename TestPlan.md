# Mento Swap Feature - Test Plan

## Introduction

The "Swap" feature in the Mento application is a critical component that allows users to exchange cryptocurrencies directly within the platform. This feature's reliability and security are essential for maintaining user trust and ensuring the smooth operation of the Mento protocol.

The purpose of this test plan is to thoroughly evaluate the "Swap" feature by identifying key functionalities, potential edge cases, and security considerations. The test plan will focus on ensuring that the feature operates as intended under various conditions, safeguarding against potential issues that could impact the user experience or the integrity of the platform. Through detailed testing, this plan aims to confirm that the "Swap" feature is robust, secure, and user-friendly, providing confidence in its deployment on the Mento platform.

## Test Objectives

### Functional Validation

- Confirm that the "Swap" feature correctly processes transactions, from token selection and amount input to the successful completion of the swap.

### Edge/Negative Case Handling

- Assess the application's behavior under edge cases, such as invalid input amounts, unsupported tokens, and insufficient balances.

### User Experience

- Ensure that the user interface is intuitive, with clear feedback provided at each step, including exchange rate display and transaction confirmation.

### Security Assurance

- Verify that the feature is secure, protecting user data and preventing vulnerabilities such as re-entrancy attacks and unauthorized access.

### Performance Testing

- Evaluate the performance of the "Swap" feature under varying network conditions and transaction volumes, ensuring consistent and reliable operation.

## Key Features of the Swap Functionality

- **Token Selection**: Users can choose a token they wish to exchange (the "from" token) and a token they wish to receive (the "to" token).
- **Real-Time Exchange Rate**: The platform displays the current exchange rate and the estimated amount the user will receive before confirming the swap.
- **Wallet Connectivity**: Users must connect a compatible digital wallet, such as MetaMask, to perform swaps. The platform supports wallet integration for seamless transactions.
- **Transaction Confirmation**: After executing a swap, users can view the transaction status in real-time, receiving immediate feedback on the success or failure of the transaction.

## Scope of the Test for the Swap Feature

### Functional Testing

- Token Selection
- Amount Input
- Exchange Rate Display
- Transaction Execution

### Integration Testing

- Wallet Integration: Testing the interaction between the Mento app and supported digital wallets.
- Blockchain Interaction: Validating the interaction between the app and the Celo blockchain.

### User Experience Testing

## Test Execution Approach

### Manual Testing

- **Scope**: As mentioned above.
- **Tools**: Web browsers (e.g., Chrome with MetaMask extension), direct interaction with the Mento app, and the Celo wallet interface.

### Automated Testing

- **Scope**: High priority key test cases mentioned above to be automated [For assessment purpose automated few of them].
- **Tools**: Synpress, Playwright, Typescript.

## Record Findings

### Improvements:

- **Behaviour**: On https://app.mento.org/ landing page even after getting connected to metamask account unless the balance is loaded and appearing, users trying to click on continue see the `Amount Exceeds Balance` even if they have the balance.
- **Suggestion**: We could disable the From value unless the amount is fetched for connected users

- **Behaviour**: Users cancelling performing swap dialogue still see the metamask extension.
- **Suggestion**: Metamask dialogue should also be closed while user cancels the swap.
