# Intro

The "Swap" feature in the Mento application is a critical component that allows users to exchange cryptocurrencies directly within the platform. This feature's reliability and security are essential for maintaining user trust and ensuring the smooth operation of the Mento protocol.

```

5. Build cache with our CLI by using a script:

```bash
# You can either build cache in a headed mode:
pnpm run build:cache

# Or in a headless mode:
pnpm run build:cache:headless
```

6. Run Playwright tests as you would normally do:

```bash
# Use one of our scripts:
pnpm run test:playwright:headful
pnpm run test:playwright:headless
